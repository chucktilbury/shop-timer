# Shop Timer
A GTK application to facilitate tracking time and inventory for a small manufacturing shop.

The goal of this application is to simply track the cost of producing an object in a shop. An object (AKA an assembly) is composed of parts and each part can itself bean assembly. So this application tracks the cost of an assembly by attempting to track the materials, consumables, and the time that went into making it. 

## Work Flow
The workflow looks something like this:
* An assembly is requested. It can be in currently in inventory, partially made, or it may need to be created from scratch. 
* The parts and assemblies that need to be created are calculated and an approximate delivery time is created. If necessary, a "build" is created.
* The Build organizes the individual parts and assemblies that are ultimately required by the deliverable into a sequential order.
* Each day, the user can create shop work orders for individual parts or assemblies that will be handed out to workers to facilitate building the deliverable. 
* As the parts and assemblies are delivered they are moved in to the inventory. If a part or assembly is used to build something, it's taken out of the inventory and replaced by the result.

### Assemblies
An assembly could be something that is ready to sell from inventory, or it could be something that will be combined with other parts and assemblies to complete a product. The cost of an assembly is the sum of the parts, sub-assemblies, consumables, and the time that it takes to finish it. 

### Parts
A part is an indivisible unit that could be something that could be sold out of inventory, or it could be created. The cost of a part is raw materials, consumables, and time.

### Raw Materials  
A raw material is physical product that remains in the product as it is sold to the customer. For example if a part is made from aluminum tubing, the cost of the consumable would be the total cost of the tubing in inches, including things like tax and shipping. 
   
### Consumables  
A consumable is a physical product that does not remain in the product as it ships to the customer. For example, sandpaper or drill bits. The cost of sandpaper would the what was payed for it, including tax and shipping. The cost of a drill bit would be amortized over the life of the bit. There was a cost to buy it and it will be used a number of times, etc.  
  
### Time
Time is tracked in minutes and ultimately the cost is based upon who did the work and what their actual cost per minute is.
